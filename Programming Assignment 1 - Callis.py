# ## Directions
# 
# 
# The purpose of this assignment is to give you an introduction to machine learning by implementing two
# fairly simple learning algorithms. These two algorithms are called Winnow-2 (introduced in Module 01)
# and Na√Øve Bayes (introduced in Module 02). For this assignment, you will use the following five datasets
# that you will download from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, namely:
# 
# 1. Breast Cancer
# https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Original%29
# This breast cancer databases was obtained from the University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison from
# Dr. William H. Wolberg.
# 
# 2. Glass
# https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Glass+Identification
# The study of classification of types of glass was motivated by criminological investigation.
# 
# 3. Iris
# https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris
# The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant.
# 
# 4. Soybean (small)
# https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Soybean+%28Small%29
# A small subset of the original soybean database.
# 
# 5. Vote ‚Äî https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Congressional+Voting+Records
# This data set includes votes for each of the U.S. House of Representatives Congressmen on the 16 key
# votes identified by the Congressional Quarterly Almanac.

# ### When using these data sets, be careful of some issues:
# 
# 
# 1. Not all of these data sets correspond to 2-class classification problems. For Na√Øve Bayes, that is not
# really problem. But for Winnow-2, you will need to use one classifier for each class. To be fair in
# comparing the two, you may want to generate Boolean classifiers for Na√Øve Bayes, even though this is
# not strictly required.
# 
# 2. Some of the data sets have missing attribute values. When this occurs in low numbers, you may simply
# edit the corresponding values out of the data sets. For more occurrences, you should do some kind of
# ‚Äúdata imputation‚Äù where, basically, you generate a value of some kind. This can be purely random, or
# it can be sampled according to the conditional probability of the values occurring, given the underlying
# class for that example. The choice is yours, but be sure to document your choice.
# 
# 3. Most of attributes in the various data sets are either multi-value discrete (categorical) or real-valued.
# You will need to deal with this in some way. For the multi-value situation, once again Na√Øve Bayes
# should be fine, but Winnow-2 will have a problem. In that case, you can apply what is called ‚Äúonehot
# coding‚Äù where you create a separate Boolean attribute for each value. Again, I recommend you
# go ahead and use this for Na√Øve Bayes, even though it is not really necessary. For the continuous
# attributes, you will need to discretize them in some way for both algorithms and then proceed as in
# the multi-valued categorical case.

# ### For this project, the following steps are required:
# 
#  Download the five (5) data sets from the UCI Machine Learning repository. You can find this repository
# at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/. All of the specific URLs are also provided above.
# 1
# 
#  Pre-process each data set as necessary to handle missing data and non-Boolean data (both classes and
# attributes).
# 
#  Set up your test and training sets from the provided data. Specifically, split the data into two groups
# randomly where 2/3 of the data will be used for training and 1/3 will be used for testing. If you
# are more ambitious, you may set up a cross-validation experiment. In that case, I recommend either
# 10-fold cross-validation or 5 
# 
#  2 cross-validation. If you don‚Äôt know what this means, don‚Äôt worry
# about it for now.
# 
#  Implement both Na√Øve Bayes and Winnow-2.
# 
#  Run your algorithms on each of the five the data sets. These runs should output the learned models
# in a way that can be interpreted by a human, and they should output the classifications on all of the
# test examples. If you are doing cross-validation, just output classifications for one fold each.
# 
#  Write a very brief paper that incorporates the following elements, summarizing the results of your
# experiments. You should also output the summary statistics on classification accuracy.
# 1. Title and author name
# 2. A brief, one paragraph abstract summarizing the results of the experiments
# 3. Problem statement, including hypothesis, projecting how you expect each algorithm to perform
# 4. Brief description of algorithms implemented
# 5. Brief description of your experimental approach
# 6. Presentation of the results of your experiments
# 7. A discussion of the behavior of your algorithms, combined with any conclusions you can draw
# 8. Summary
# 9. References (you should have at least one reference related to each of the algorithms implemented,a reference to the data sources, and any other references you consider to be relevant)
# 
#  Submit your fully documented code, the outputs from running your programs, and your paper. Your
# grade will be broken down as follows:
# ‚Äì Code structure ‚Äì 10%
# ‚Äì Code documentation/commenting ‚Äì 10%
# ‚Äì Proper functioning of your code, as illustrated by a 5 minute video ‚Äì 30%
# ‚Äì Summary paper ‚Äì 50%

# # Supervised Learning
# 
# Goal: Make a prediction
#    - Estimate a function f(x) so that y = f(x)
#    
# Where y can be:
#    - Real Number: Regression
#    - Categorical: Classification
#    - Complex Object: Ranking # of items, parse tree, etc.
#    
# Data is labeled:
#    - Data has many pairs { (x, y) }
#        - x: Vector of binary, categorical, real valued features/attributes
#        - y: class ( {+1, -1}, or a real number )
#        
# Method:
#    - Create subsets of data:
#        - Training Set
#        - Testing Set
#    - Estimate y = f(x) on X, Y
#    - Assume the same f(x) generalizes (i.e., works on unseen X', Y')
#    
#    
# # Linear Models for Classification
# 
# ## Binary Classification
# 
# Decision boundary is linear
# $$f(x) =  \begin{bmatrix}+1 & if w_{1}x_{1}+w_{2}x_{2}+...+w_{d}x_{d} \ge \theta \\-1 & otherwise \end{bmatrix}$$
# 
# ### Input
# 
# Vectors $x^{i}$
#     - Inputs to the model are feature (or attribute) values
# 
# Each feature has a weight $w_{i}$
# 
# Class Labels $y^{j}$
# 
# ### Goal
# 
# The model must learn how to map specific examples to class labels, or y = x(x) in a way that minimizes the error of misclassification
# 
# Find vector $w = (w_{1}, w_{2}, ... , w_{d})$

# # Winnow-2
# 
# **Online Supervised Learning Algorithm**
# 
# Can adjust to changing target, over time
# 
# **Overview:**
#     - Learner (prediction model) receives a data instance
#             - Attribute values must be binary (must use one-hot encoding)
#     - Learner makes a prediction of the class to which the data instance belongs by assigning a label:
#             - Learner predicts 0 if data instance doesn't belong to class (benign)
#             - Learner predicts 1 if data instance does belong to class (malignant)
#     - Learner is told whether the prediction is accurate 
#             - If prediction was correct: Nothing happens
#             - If prediction was incorrect: Learning occurs (i.e., amending the mathematical model)
#            

# ### Learner Receives Data Instance (Prediction Model)
# 
# **Assume x is a real-valued feature vector**, $\left||x|\right|_{2} = 1$
# 
# 
# **Takes the weighted sum over the dimensions of each of the attributes**
# 
# $$f(x)=\sum_{i=1}^{d} w_{i}x_{i}$$
# 
# where,
# 
#  d is the total number of attributes
# 
# $\ w_{i}$ is the weighting of the ith attribute
# 
# $\ x_{i}$ is the value of the ith attribute in binary format
# 
#  f(x) is the weighted sum (e.g., $\ w_{1}x_{1} + w_{2}x_{2} + w_{3}x_{3} + ‚Ä¶. + w_{d}x_{d}$)

# ### Learner Makes a Prediction
# 
# **Prediction:** $h(x) = +1 iff (w * x) \ge \theta$
# 
# **Threshold:** $\theta$
#     - Commonly set to 0.5
# 
# **Weight Vector**
# Initially, all the weights $\ w_{i}$ for each attribute are set to 1
# 
# **Initialize:** 
# 
# $\theta = \frac{d}{2}$
# 
# $w = \frac{1}{d}, ... ,\frac {1}{d}$
# 
# *Weight Vector*: Initially, all the weights $\ w_{i}$ for each attribute are set to 1
# 
# **For every training example $x^{(t)}$, compute:**
# 
# $y^{'}= f (x^{t})$
# 
# **Prediction Decision:**
# $h(x) =  \begin{bmatrix}1 & f(x)>\theta \\0 & otherwise \end{bmatrix}$

# ### Learner Is Told Whether Prediction Is Accurate
# 
# **Learning**
# 
# i.e., if no mistake: $(y^{t} = y^{'})$
# 
# i.e., if mistake: 
# $\ w_{i}$ <-- $\ w_{i}$ * ($\exp^{ny}{x_{i}^{t}}$ \ $\ (Z^{t}))$
# 
# Because we are updating multiplicatively, all weights remain positive
#     - In order to predict positive there must be ‚Äúenough‚Äù evidence
#     - Thus we make more progress when we make a mistake.
#     
# **Adjustment Constant for Promotion & Demotion**
# $\alpha$ =2
# 
# **There are two types of incorrect predictions:**
# 
#     ```
#     | Learner's Prediction |   Correct Class    | Failure Called | Learning Type |
#     |----------------------|--------------------|----------------|---------------|
#     | 0 (does not belong)  | 1 (does belong)    | False Negative |   Promotion   |
#     | 1 (ddoes belong)     | 0 (does not belong)| False Positive |   Demotion    |
#     ```
# 
# **Promotion**
#     - Learner's Prediction: 0 (does not belong)
#     - Correct Class: 1 (does belong)
#     - Update Action Taken: (learning = promotion)
# $w_{i} = \begin{bmatrix} \alpha * w_{i} & if x_{i}=1 \end{bmatrix}$
# 
# 
# **Demotion**
#     - Learner's Prediction: 1 (does belong)
#     - Correct Class: 0 (does not belong)
#     - Update Action Taken: (learning = demotion)
# $w_{i} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac {w_{i}} {\alpha} & if x_{i}=1 \end{bmatrix}$
# 
# 
# ### Proceed Row-by-Row 
# 
# Continue row-by-row through the original data set (one instance at a time)
# 
# ### Advantages
#     - Simple
#     - Guaranteed to learn a linearly separable problem
#     - Suitable for problems with many irrelevant attributes
#     
# ### Limitations
#     - Only linearly separable problems
#     - Only converges for linearly separable data
#     - Not really efficient with many features

# Implementation of the Winnow-2 Algorithm

'''''
Class: Winnow2
    - Supervised Learning Algorithm for 2-class classification problems.Learner receives 
    a data instance (a vector boolean attribute) and then makes a prediction for the data instance 
    by assigning a label of 0 (doesn't belong) or 1 (does belong). Then, the learner is told whether 
    the prediction is accurate. 

Functions:
    - __init__: Initializes the Winnow2 algorithm 
    - predict_probability: Function gets the nonbinary prediction probability
    - binary_prediction: Function gets the binary prediction
    - adjust_weights: Function adjusts the weights of each attribute
    - promote_weights: If learner predicts 0 when class is 1, then for all x_{i} = 1, w_{i}*weight_scaler_alpha.
    - demote_weights: If learner predicts 1 when class i 0, then for all x_{i} = 0, w_{i}/weight_scaler_alpha
    - run_training_prediction: Runs a single instance of Winnow-2 prediction
    - fit: Fits model f(x) = Sum(w_{i}*x_{i}) by predicting class label (1 = belongs; 0 = otherwise) 
    if model > threshold_theta.

# # Naive Bayes
# 
# **Online Supervised Learning Algorithm**
# 
# Seek the best class that matches the features of the data.
# 
# Provides a probabilistic model: we are interested in estimating the conditional probability of the class label, given the observation.
# 
# **Overview:**
# 
# Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm for binary (two-class) and multiclass classification problems. 
# 
# "Naive" Bayes because the calculations of the probabilities for each class are simplified to make their calculations tractable.
# 
# Bayes‚Äô Theorem provides a way to calculate the probability of a piece of data belonging to a given class, given our prior knowledge:
# 
# $$P(Class|Data) = \frac{P(Data|Class)P(Class)}{P(Data)}$$
# 
# Where, 
#     P(Class): Prior Probability
#     
#     P(Class|Data): Posterior Probability is the conditional probability of the class given the provided data
#     
#     P(Data|Class): Likelihoods (or base rates)
#     
#     P(Data): Total probability; Used as a constant to normalize the result
#     

# Rather than attempting to calculate the probabilities of each attribute value, they are assumed to be conditionally independent given the class value.
#     - The conditional probability of all variables given the class label is changed into separate conditional probabilities of each variable value given the class label
#     - These independent conditional variables are then multiplied together
# 
#     
# $P(y_{i} | x_{1}, x_{2}, ‚Ä¶, x_{i}) = P(x_{1}, x_{2}, ‚Ä¶, x_{i} | y_{i}) * P(y_{i})$
#     
# then becomes:
#    
# $P(y_{i} | x_{1}, x_{2}, ‚Ä¶, x_{i}) = P(x_{1}|y_{i}) * P(x_{2}|y_{i}) * ‚Ä¶ P(x_{n}|y_{i}) * P(y_{i})$
# 
# where,
# 
# $ class label = y_{i} $
# 
# $ attribute observation = x_{i}$
# 

# *Avoiding Numerical Underflow with Log*
# 
# The calculation of the independent conditional probability for one example for one class label involves multiplying many probabilities together, one for the class and one for each input variable. As such, the multiplication of many small numbers together can become numerically unstable, especially as the number of input variables increases.
# 
# To overcome this problem, it is common to change the calculation from the product of probabilities to the sum of log probabilities. For example:
# 
# $P(y_{i} | x_{1}, x_{2}, ‚Ä¶, x_{i}) = log(P(x_{1}|y_{i})) + log(P(x_{2}|y_{i})) + ‚Ä¶ + log(P(x_{n}|y_{i})) + log(P(y_{i}))$
# 
# 
# Effect: Creates larger (negative) numbers and adding the numbers together will mean that larger probabilities will be closer to zero. The resulting values can still be compared and maximized to give the most likely class label.
# 

# **Decision Rule**
# 
# Conditional probability calculation is performed for each of the class labels.
# 
# *Maximum A Posteriori (MAP):* The label with the largest probability is selected as the classification for the given instance. 

# ### Calculating Prior Probabilities
# 
# Prior Probability = P(Class) = $P(y_{i})$
# 
# To calculate,
# 
# $P(y_{i})$ = $\frac {\sum count of observations with y_{i}} {total number of observations}$

# ### Calculating Conditional Posterior Probabilities
# 
# The conditional probability for a feature value given the class label is estimated from the data. 
#     - Includes data observations that belong to a given class, and one data distribution per variable. 
#     - If there are K classes and n variables, then k * n different probability distributions must be created and maintained.
#     
#     
# **Data Types**
# 
# Depending on data type (of each feature), may need to estimate the parameters of one of three standard probability distributions:
# 
# 1. Binary Data: Binomial Distribution
# 2. Categoriocal Data: Multinomial Distribution
# 3. Numeric Data: Gaussian Distribution
# 

# ## Naive Bayes Algorithm Steps
# 
# 1. Create Train & Test Subsets
# 2. Training Data: Separate By Class
#     - Separate training data by class
#     - Calculate Prior Probability or base rate: P(Class)
# 3. Training Data: Summarize Dataset
#     - Calculate mean for each attribute and class
#     - Calculate standard deviation of each attribute
#     - Explore other EDA
# 4. Training Data: Summarize Data By Class
#     - Calculate likelihoods: P(Data|Class). Conditional probabilities for each of the features
#     - Calculate mean for each attribute by class
#     - Calculate standard deviation for each attribute by class
# 5. Training Data: Binomial, Gaussian, Multinomial Probability Density Function.
#     - Calculate probability density function
# 6. Testing Data: Class Predictions P(Class|Data)
#     - Calculate probability that data belongs to first class: 
#     $P(class_{1}|data) = P(x_{i}|class_{1}) * P(class_{1})$
#     - Calculate probability that data belongs to second class:
#     $P(class_{0}|data) = P(x_{i}|class_{0}) * P(class_{0})$
#     - Value is maximized:the calculation for the class that results in the largest value is taken as the prediction
#     - Add additional column to testing set
#     N + 1: Predicted Class
# 7. Assess whether prediction was correct
#     - Add additional column to testing set
#     N + 2: Prediction Correct? (1 if yes, 0 if no)

# # Classification Metrics
# 
# Loss functions are used by algorithms to learn the classification models from the data.
# 
# Classification metrics, however, evaluate the classification models themselves. 
# 
# For a binary classification task, where "1" is taken to mean "positive" or "in the class" and "0" is taken to be "negative" or "not in the class", the cases are:
# 
# 1. The true class can be "1" and the model can predict "1". This is a *true positive* or TP.
# 2. The true class can be "1" and the model can predict "0". This is a *false negative* or FN.
# 3. The true class can be "0" and the model can predict "1". This is a *false positive* or FP.
# 4. The true class can be "0" and the model can predict "0". This is a *true negative* or TN.
# 

# ## Cross Validation
# 
# Fundamental assumption of machine learning:The data that you train your model on must come from the same distribution as the data you hope to apply the model to.
# 
# Options:
#     - Divide your data into two sets:
#         1. The training set which you use to build the model
#         2. The test(ing) set which you use to evaluate the model. 
#     - kfolds: Yields multiple estimates of evaluation metric
#     
# ### kfold Cross Validation
# 
# Looks like:
# 
# |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |  9  |  10 |
